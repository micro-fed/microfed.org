## üîß Core Components

Microfed Core comprises the following components:

1. **Configuration Management**: Handles settings and configuration for the framework, including user preferences, application settings, and module configurations.
2. **Module Loader**: Manages the loading, initialization, and communication between Microfed modules, such as the Profile, Inbox, Outbox, and Authentication modules.
3. **ActivityPub Adapter**: Provides a set of utility functions and classes to interact with ActivityPub, parse and serialize data, and manage ActivityPub objects.
4. **Networking**: Handles networking tasks, such as HTTP requests, WebSocket connections, and peer-to-peer communication.

## üåê ActivityPub Integration

Microfed Core integrates with ActivityPub using the ActivityPub Adapter component. The adapter offers the following functionality:

1. **ActivityPub Objects**: Defines classes for ActivityPub objects, such as Activities, Actors, and Objects, including methods to manipulate and interact with these objects.
2. **Parsing and Serialization**: Provides utility functions to parse and serialize ActivityPub objects from/to JSON-LD format.
3. **Activity Handling**: Implements methods for processing incoming and outgoing activities, such as Create, Update, Delete, Follow, and Like, according to the ActivityPub specification.
4. **ActivityPub API**: Offers an API for interacting with ActivityPub services, such as fetching and updating Actor profiles, sending activities, and managing followers and following collections.

## üóÑÔ∏è API Interface

Microfed Core exposes a simple and intuitive API interface for developers to interact with the framework and its modules. The API includes methods for:

1. **Module Management**: Registering, initializing, and accessing Microfed modules.
2. **ActivityPub Interaction**: Sending and receiving ActivityPub activities, managing Actor profiles, and handling collections.
3. **Utility Functions**: Accessing common utility functions, such as data validation, conversion, and formatting.

## üîç Error Handling and Logging

Microfed Core provides a robust error handling and logging system to ensure that any issues or errors are properly reported and logged. This system includes:

1. **Error Classes**: Custom error classes for different types of errors that can occur within Microfed Core and its modules.
2. **Error Reporting**: Methods for reporting errors to the user or developer, with context-specific information and suggestions for resolving the issue.
3. **Logging**: A flexible logging system that supports different log levels, log formats, and log destinations (e.g., console, file, or remote server).
