## Profile Components

Microfed Profile comprises the following components:

1. **Profile Manager**: Handles the creation, updating, and retrieval of user profiles, as well as profile data management.
2. **ActivityPub Profile Adapter**: Provides utility functions and classes to interact with ActivityPub profiles, parse and serialize profile data, and manage ActivityPub objects related to profiles.
3. **WebFinger Adapter**: Offers utility functions to discover and resolve user profiles using WebFinger protocol.
4. **Profile API**: Exposes an API for interacting with profiles, including fetching, updating, and managing connections.

## ActivityPub Profile Integration

Microfed Profile integrates with ActivityPub using the ActivityPub Profile Adapter component. The adapter offers the following functionality:

1. **Profile Objects**: Defines classes for ActivityPub profiles, including methods to manipulate and interact with profile data.
2. **Parsing and Serialization**: Provides utility functions to parse and serialize ActivityPub profile data from/to JSON-LD format.
3. **Profile Interaction**: Implements methods for interacting with profiles according to the ActivityPub specification, such as fetching profile data, updating profile attributes, and managing connections (followers, following, etc.).

## WebFinger Integration

Microfed Profile integrates with the WebFinger protocol using the WebFinger Adapter component. This adapter provides the following functionality:

1. **Profile Discovery**: Offers methods to discover user profiles based on their WebFinger identifiers (e.g., user@example.com).
2. **Profile Resolution**: Implements methods to resolve WebFinger identifiers to actual profile URLs, making it easier to interact with profiles across different platforms.

## API Interface

Microfed Profile exposes a simple and intuitive API interface for developers to interact with user profiles and their related ActivityPub and WebFinger functionality. The API includes methods for:

1. **Profile Management**: Creating, updating, and retrieving user profiles.
2. **ActivityPub Interaction**: Fetching and updating ActivityPub profiles, and managing connections (followers, following, etc.).
3. **WebFinger Interaction**: Discovering and resolving user profiles using WebFinger identifiers.

## Error Handling and Logging

Microfed Profile provides robust error handling and logging to ensure that any issues or errors are properly reported and logged. This system includes:

1. **Error Classes**: Custom error classes for different types of errors that can occur within the Microfed Profile module.
2. **Error Reporting**: Methods for reporting errors to the user or developer, with context-specific information and suggestions for resolving the issue.
3. **Logging**: A flexible logging system that supports different log levels, log formats, and log destinations (e.g., console, file, or remote server).
